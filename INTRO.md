**Introduction:**  
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,  

I’m **Vamsi Krishna**, and I’m excited to be here today to share my journey, experiences, and contributions throughout my career. With over **7 years of experience in IT** — including **2.11 years at EPAM Systems** — I’ve had the privilege of working on **three major projects** for the same client as a **key front-end developer**. During this time, I was honored to receive the **Customer Focus badge**, which reflects my dedication to delivering impactful solutions with a user-first mindset.  

### **Professional Background and Core Competencies:**  
My primary expertise lies in **Front-end Development**, specifically with **JavaScript** and **React.js**. Over the years, I’ve built strong proficiency in:  
- **React, Redux, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML, and CSS** for robust UI development.  
- Frameworks and libraries like **Kendo-UI, Material UI**.  
- **CI/CD pipelines**, **unit testing** with **Jest and React Testing Library**, and **SDLC best practices**.  
- Hands-on experience with **Agile methodologies**, specifically **Scrum** and **Kanban**, for efficient project management.  

I’m constantly refining my skills, particularly in areas like **adaptability, web performance optimization, and software engineering principles**, to stay aligned with industry standards.

### **Key Project Contributions:**  

### **1. Current Project – EDM, EPAM Systems (Client: S&P Global):**  
Currently, I’m part of the **EDM** project — a data management platform that provides transparency and trust in data by acquiring, validating, and distributing operational and financial data. My role primarily focuses on:  
- Taking **ownership of the UI development process** and creating **generic, reusable React components**.  
- **Integration with GraphQL APIs** and building services to manage data flow efficiently.  
- Maintaining high **unit test coverage** with Jest and ensuring **code quality** through **SonarQube**.  
- Developing various user interface components, such as **Grid**, **Charts**, **Accordion**, and **Drawer**, while adhering to **WCAG and ADA standards** for accessibility.  
- Actively contributing during sprint planning for **task clarification and decomposition**.  
- Mentoring and guiding **junior developers**, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.  

One of my proudest achievements on this project was identifying potential challenges early on, which ensured the **timely delivery of high-quality, error-free UI components**.

### **Closing:**  
To sum up, my journey has been about continuous growth — from honing core technical skills to actively contributing to team success and striving for excellence. I’m passionate about building impactful solutions and continuously learning to improve my craft.  

I’m looking forward to discussing my experiences, answering any questions you may have, and receiving feedback that can help me grow further.
